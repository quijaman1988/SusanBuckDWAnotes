## Goal
It's time for an exercise that will combine *variables*, *if* constructs and *functions* all together.

The general idea for this exercise is simple: **create an app that tells time**.
Depending on when in the day a user visits your page, they will see different results.

## Specs

If your user visits your page between 5am and 10:59am in the morning, they should see this image:

If they visit between 11am and 3:59pm in the afternoon, they should see this image:

If they visit between 8pm and 4:59am in the evening, they should see this image:

## Background color

The background color of the page should match the scenery image they're seeing.
For example, if it's morning time, the background color should be purple (`#856f86`).
