[php.net Alternative syntax](http://us1.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.alternative-syntax.php)

Compare and contrast the following code:

Version A)

~~~php
<h1>Contestants</h1>
<?php
foreach($contestants as $key => $value) {
	echo $key." is a ".$value."!<br>";
}
?>
~~~

Version B)

~~~php
<h1>Contestants</h1>
<?php foreach($contestants as $key => $value): ?>
	<?=$key?> is a <?=$value?>
<?php endforeach; ?>
~~~

Note the differences:

* Version B replaces the *opening* curly brace with a colon
* Version replaces the *closing* curly brace with a `endforeach;`

This syntax is sometimes preferred when writing PHP in your display page, because it makes it easier to find the end of the foreach loop amongst a lot of HTML code.

Note, also, how we open and close the php tags a lot, really isolating the PHP pieces from the HTML pieces. This comes in handy when you have a lot more HTML tags.

To compare and contrast, look at these two lines:

HTML is dominant, with PHP injected

~~~php
<div class='person-name'><?=$key?></div> is a <em class='results'><?=$value?></div>
~~~

PHP is dominant, with HTML injected

~~~php
<?php
echo "<div class='person-name'>".$key." is a <em class='results'>".$value."</div>";
?>
~~~

In terms of working in your display page, the first option is more readable and tag-like.

The same substitutions can also be made with *if statements* and other similar control structures.

For example, here's a HTML form wrapped in a if statement:

~~~php
<?php if($new_user): ?>

	<h2>Welcome New User!</h2>
	<form>
		<label for='first_name'>First Name<br>
		<input type='text' name='first_name' id='first_name'>

		<label for='email'>Email<br>
		<input type='text' name='email' id='email'>

		<input type='submit'>
	</form>

<?php endif; ?>
~~~

__Note:__
This alternative structure is only recommended for your display PHP pages, *not* your logic PHP pages. In the display pages, HTML should reign; in the logic page, PHP should reign.
