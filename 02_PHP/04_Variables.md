Variables are used to store information so that it can easily be retrieved and manipulated in your scripts.

In PHP the name of a variable is always preceded by a dollar sign `$`.

You assign values to variables using the *assignment operator* equal sign `=`.

~~~php
<?php
$favorite_color = 'red';
?>
~~~

PHP variables don't have to be declared before they're used. Setting a variable for the first time is simultaneously declaring that variable.

Variable names should start with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.


## Assignment methods

### Assignment by value

By default, when you assign one variable to another, it **copies** the original value to the new one.

This means that any changes to the new variable will not affect the original.

Example:

~~~php
$foo = 1;
$bar = $foo;
$bar = 2; # Change $bar, yet $foo will remain 1
echo $foo; # Outputs 1
~~~

### Assignment by reference

When assigning a variable *by reference*, both variables will point to the same data; nothing is copied.

Assigning a variable by reference is done with an ampersand.

Example:

~~~php
$foo = 1;
$bar = &$foo;
$bar = 2;
echo $foo; # Outputs 2
~~~

Below we'll talk more about how you can pass variables to functions by reference.


## Displaying variables

One way to output variables from your script, is to use the `echo` construct.

~~~php
$age = 50;
echo $age; # Outputs 50
~~~

When outputting variables in HTML, you'll typically see code written in a more compact fashion:

~~~php
<p>
	My favorite color is <?php echo $favorite_color; ?>
</p>
~~~



## Data types

PHP has 8 different [data types](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.php):

* Strings <small>(always surrounded in quotes)</small>
* Integers
* Floating point numbers
* Booleans
* Arrays
* Objects
* Resource
* NULL

In other programming languages, when declaring a variable you often have to specify the data type of that variable.

For example in Java you might say:

~~~
int votes
~~~

In PHP you don't have to explicitly set a variable's data type; instead, PHP will automatically determine the type for you.

~~~php
$votes = 100;       # Give it an integer, it'll be an integer
$votes = "Unknown"; # Give it a string, it'll be a string
$votes = "100";		# Gave it a number, but it's in quotes, so it'll be a string.
~~~

If you want to find out what type a variable is, use [`gettype()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.gettype.php).




## Type Juggling

PHP doesn't support explicit variable typing.

The downside of this is it's not always clear what kind of data you expect to be stored in a variable. For example, when defining class attributes, it'd be useful to indicate to other developers what kind of data type should be used for a given attribute. One way to address this is to use [PHPDocs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc) style commenting and indicate in your comments what variable type you're expecting.

For example:

	/**
	 * A string that should be prepended to keys.
	 *
	 * @var string
	 */
	protected $prefix;

This wouldn't make it required that `$prefix` be a *string*, but it'd at least be a clue to collaborators.




### Type casting

While you don't have to set variable types, you can convert variable types using type casting. This is done by prefixing a value with your desired type in parenthesis.

For example, you could convert a decimal number to an integer:

~~~php
$votes = (int)10.9;  # Cast Double to an Integer
echo gettype($votes) # Outputs "integer"
echo $votes;         # Outputs 10
~~~






## Variable Scope

Variables in PHP have four possible scopes:

* global
* local
* static
* function parameters

The scope of a variable is controlled by where the variable is declared.

### Global variables

A variable declared **outside a function** is **global**. This means it is visible to any part of the script, *except* inside of functions.

Given that, the following would not work:

~~~php
function report_votes() {
	echo "Vote count:".$votes;
}

$votes = 50; # Global
report_votes();
~~~

The reason is because the variable `$votes` is global, and therefor when you try to use it inside the `report_votes()` function, it doesn't know what you're talking about.

In order to make a global variable visible in a function, you have to use the **global keyword**.

You could fix the above code like this:

~~~php
function report_votes() {
	global $votes; 	# Makes the global variable $votes visible inside this function
	echo "Vote count:".$votes;
}

$votes = 50; # Global
report_votes(); # Outputs "Vote count: 50"
~~~

### Local variables

A variable declared **in a function** is **local** to that function. This mean it's only visible to the code in that function; it is not visible outside the function.

~~~php
function upvote() {
	$votes++; # Local
}

$votes = 50; # Global
upvote();
echo $votes; # Outputs 50
~~~


### Static variables

Static variables are used in functions, and visible only in functions; they are used to remember a variable's value across multiple function calls.

Example:

~~~php
function upvote() {
	static $votes = 99;
	$votes++;
	echo $votes.'<br>';
}

upvote(); # Outputs 100
upvote(); # Outputs 101
upvote(); # Outputs 102
upvote(); # Outputs 103
~~~

### Function variables

Function variables are defined via the parameters of a function call, and are local to the given function.

Example:

~~~php
function upvote($votes) {
	$votes++;
	echo $votes.'<br>';
}

upvote(99);  # Outputs 100
echo $votes; # Undefined
~~~




## Variable References

We already talked about assigning variables by reference, now let's look at how they're used in functions...

If you pass a variable **by reference** to a function, **that function has the ability to modify the variable you're passing**.

For example, let's start with a scenario where the parameter passed to a function is *not* passed by reference:

~~~php
function upvote($votes) {
	$votes++;
}

$votes = 50;
upvote($votes);
echo $votes; # Outputs 50
~~~


Note how `$votes` is incremented inside the function, but the end result is still 50. This is because the *local* `$votes` used in the function is independent from the *global* `$votes` used outside the function.

Now let's look at that same function, but this time the parameter *is* passed by reference (as indicated with the ampersand):

~~~php
function upvote(&$votes) {
	$votes++;
}

$votes = 50;
upvote($votes);
echo $votes.'<br>'; # Outputs 51
~~~

This time, the end result is 51 because the *global* `$votes` variable was passed by reference, allowing it to be updated locally in the function.




## Summary

Given all the above, you may notice that the different variable scopes can be used to achieve the same result.

For example, image this scenario:

You're starting out with 100 votes.
You want a function to increase the votes by 1 each time it is called, and echo the results.
The final output should thus be:

	101
	102
	103

### Using a global variable...

~~~php
function upvote() {

	global $votes;
	$votes++;
	echo $votes.'<br>';

}

$votes = 100;
upvote(); # Outputs 101
upvote(); # Outputs 102
upvote(); # Outputs 103
~~~


### Using a static variable...

~~~php
function upvote() {

	static $votes = 100;
	$votes++;
	echo $votes.'<br>';

}

upvote(); # Outputs 101
upvote(); # Outputs 102
upvote(); # Outputs 103
~~~


### Using a variable reference....

~~~php
function upvote(&$votes) {

	$votes++;
	echo $votes.'<br>';

}

$votes = 100;
upvote($votes); # Outputs 101
upvote($votes); # Outputs 102
upvote($votes); # Outputs 103
~~~
