A framework is a package of code.

Included in this package are tools which power the essentials of application development, including:

* Routing
* Environment management
* Database interaction
* User authentication
* etc.

By working with these existing fundamentals, it frees you up to focus on the functionality of *your* application.

In addition to this, a framework provides a **skeleton** in which to build your application.

__Benefits:___

* Don't reinvent the wheel.
* Work with tried and tested code.
* Write code that is more universally understood.
