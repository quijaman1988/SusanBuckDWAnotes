# Lecture notes for Dynamic Web Applications
Fall 2015
Short URL: <http://notes.dwa15.com>

## Introduction
It's difficult to pick one definitive textbook for a course on web development. The technology we're working with rapidly changes and traditional textbooks often become quickly outdated.

Given this, as an alternative to a traditional textbook, I share my lecture notes via this Github repository. These notes are your primary resources for this course, as they are customized to the material we're covering in lecture.

In addition to these notes, you will also rely heavily on the following online resources:

+ [Official PHP documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/)
+ [Official Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2)
+ [Laravel Cheat Sheet](http://www.linxiang.info/l5-cs/)
* [Pro Git book](http://git-scm.com/book)


## Printing
Use http://gitprint.com if you want to create .pdfs or printable versions of the notes.


## Reporting issues
Use Github's Issues section to report any issues with the notes. Examples of the kind of issues that may need reporting:
+ Typos
+ Code samples not working as described
+ Broken or moved links
+ Etc.


## FAQ: Can you publish the notes ahead of time?
Every semester, there are determined and excited students wishing to get ahead, which on one hand I think is great. On the other hand, it creates some management problems.

As discussed above, in a class such as this, things change fast. Every semester I have to update notes to keep them current with the latest technology and procedures. If students work ahead from previous semester's notes, they're bound to hit bumps when instructions no longer work as described. It's also possible that I've improved something early on in the course and that change hasn't yet been cascaded to later notes.

When this happens, confusion tends to ensue as students start to post questions on topics we haven't yet covered. This causes some other students to panic, thinking they're behind or have missed something they should be doing. It also creates more volume in Piazza, making it harder for the teaching team to keep up with students asking questions about the current material.

Given all of the above, I will only post notes as we reach them.


## FAQ: I still really like books. Can you recommend some books?
Sure! Here are some selected books that would supplement this course. Some are available as traditional books, some are E-book only.

__PHP__

+ [PHP Pandas](http://daylerees.com/php-pandas): Dayle Rees can be silly at times, but he has a very approachable teaching method.
+ [Modern PHP](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033868.do): O'Reilly is typically a dependable resource when it comes to programming books.

__Laravel__

+ [Easy Laravel 5](http://www.easylaravelbook.com/): Takes a project based approach to walking through Laravel.
+ [Code Bright](http://daylerees.com/codebright/): Another Dayle Rees book. This one is actually on Laravel 4, not Laravel 5, so the material is out of date. However, Rees' explanation of concepts is really good and there are a lot of big picture lessons to be taken from this book.
